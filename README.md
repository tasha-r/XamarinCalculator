# Xamarin Calculator
The purpose of this project is to develop my own knowledge of mobile application development with Xamarin, which I have never used before. I have been using some resources provided to me by my mentor from the time I spent as an Undergraduate Software Engineer at a large technology company. Although the Xamarin template I have used allows the application to be run on multiple platforms, for now I have been debugging the application using the Android platform before I move on to other operating systems. This is because this technology is still new to me, so I think it is best to move platform by platform. Once I grow more confident, I will work on altering the UI where necessary for other platforms and learn how to debug these.

For now, this application is a very simple calculator. It can perform addition, multiplication, subtraction and division between two numbers, where each number can be either whole or decimal. If needed, the calculator can be reset by pressing the 'CLEAR' button. The main focus of this application so far has been on it's creation and basic functionality implementation. Once this has been developed to a satisfactory level, I will move my attention on to the UI.

A roadmap of tasks that have been done, are in progress and are yet to be completed exists on the 'Projects' tab of this repository. Each task has the relevant pull request linked to it, if one exists.

# Running the Application
1. Pull the code to your machine
2. Open the application in Visual Studio using the solution file
3. Debug the Android application using either an Android emulator (provided by Visual Studio) or a physical Android device. Make sure the device is running a version of Android that is equal to or greater than the minimum version supported by the application.
